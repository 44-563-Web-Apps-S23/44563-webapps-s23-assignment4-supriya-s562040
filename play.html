    <h2>THE BOOR _Anton Tchekov_</h2>

    <P class="speech">
         It isn't right, ma'am. You're wearing yourself out! The maid and
        the cook have gone looking for berries; everything that breathes is
        enjoying life; even the cat knows how to be happy--slips about the
        courtyard and catches birds--but you hide yourself here in the house as
        though you were in a cloister. Yes, truly, by actual reckoning you
        haven't left this house for a whole year.
    </P>

    <h3 class="POPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h3>
    <P class="speech"> And I shall never leave it--why should I? My life is over.
        He lies in his grave, and I have buried myself within these four walls.
        We are both dead.</P>

    <h3 class="LUKA">LUKA</h3>
    <P class="speech"> What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
        walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
        and visit the neighbors?
        </P>

    <h3 class="POPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h3>
    <P id="direction">[_Weeping._] </P>

    <h3 class="LUKA">LUKA</h3>
    <P class="speech">Madam, dear madam, what is it? In Heaven's name!</P>

    <h3 class="POPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h3>
    <P class="speech">He loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
        or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
        when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby--give him
        an extra measure of oats to-day!</P>

    <h3 class="LUKA">LUKA</h3>
    <P class="speech">Yes, ma'am.</P>
